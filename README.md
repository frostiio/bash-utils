# bash-utils
test
A collection of my hand-crafted bash scripts and helper functions for various common tasks.

## Code Layout

- `bin/` is a collection of finished scripts, for doing everything you need to do related to a specific task (e.g. `dns` can both set and fetch DNS values from a variety of providers)
- `lib/` is a collection of adapters to interact with 3rd party tools or scripts, e.g. cloudflare/letsencrypt/etc
- `util/` is a collection of pure bash functions to make development in bash easier e.g. logging/configuration/error handling/etc.

## Useful Helper Commands

#### Unofficial Bash Strict Mode

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

### Bash Environment Setup
# http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/
# https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html
# set -o xtrace
# set -x
set -o errexit
set -o errtrace
set -o nounset
set -o pipefail
IFS=$'\n'

SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
```

#### `timeout`

timeout executes the ssh command (with args) and sends a SIGTERM if ssh doesn't return after 5 second. for more details about timeout, read this document： http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timeout.1.html

```bash
timeout 5 some-slow-command

# or on mac:
brew install coreutils
gtimeout 5 some-slow-command
```

#### `nohup`

#### `expect`

#### `trap`

#### `getopts` / `argbash`

```bash
# parse and handle passed CLI arguments sanely
while getopts ":mnopq:rs" Option
do
  case $Option in
    m     ) echo "Scenario #1: option -m-   [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]";;
    n | o ) echo "Scenario #2: option -$Option-   [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]";;
    p     ) echo "Scenario #3: option -p-   [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]";;
    q     ) echo "Scenario #4: option -q-\
                  with argument \"$OPTARG\"   [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]";;
    #  Note that option 'q' must have an associated argument,
    #+ otherwise it falls through to the default.
    r | s ) echo "Scenario #5: option -$Option-";;
    *     ) echo "Unimplemented option chosen.";;   # Default.
  esac
done
```

#### `trap`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
scratch=$(mktemp -d -t tmp.XXXXXXXXXX)
function finish {
  rm -rf "$scratch"
}
trap finish EXIT
```

#### `pkill`

```bash
# kill any processes matching given regex
pkill nginx
```

#### `eval`

```bash
a='$b'
b='$c'
c=d

echo $a             # $b
                    # First level.
eval echo $a        # $c
                    # Second level.
eval eval echo $a   # d
                    # Third level.
```

#### `exec`

```bash
# This shell builtin replaces the current process with a specified command
# useful for when the last command in a script is a long running process you want to kick off, and you dont want it to be a child of bash

exec some-daemon-that-runs-forever
```

#### `dpkg -s <pkgname>` / `dpkg --compare-versions "20.04.2" "ge" "18.04.12"`

check pkg info of any installed package, and compare semver/date/incremental versions easily

#### `pipeexec`

Have total control over piping between processes, including doing crazy things like piping a processes own stdout into its stdin, launching complex directed graphs of pipes as a single process, etc.
